This is the final project I submitted for my CE301 Capstone Project at the University of Esssex that was supervised by Professor Richard Bartle. 

The aim of this software was to make it easier for the user to create their own Hypertext HTML game without the need to learn HTML themselves. 

This also include the short, uncompleted game 'Heart, Soul, and Code' which I was writing during the duration of my project to test out the software and ensure that everything was working fine.
