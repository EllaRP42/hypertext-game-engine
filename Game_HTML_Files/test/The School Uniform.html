<html><head><title>The School Uniform</title><body><h1>You open the cupboard door</h1><p>The school uniform is a simple black blazer, tie, and pleated skirt with a white button up shirt, tights, and a pair of loafers. Upon getting dressed in the correct uniform, you turn and look in the mirror attatched to the cupoard door and you can see yourself fully; you are a short girl with pale skin and blue eyes with mousy brown hair flowing down to your waist.<br><br><br><br>You head downstairs, and the Professor smiles at the sight of you, "perfect, come lets head to the school". You head outside and into his car, a somewhat beaten up off-gold Ford Maverick, the only car you've ever seen on the driveway to your small two story semi-detatched house. "You're only going to be here for a hour, just an introductionary class, you'll start fully next Monday."<br><br><br><br>The ride lasted for around 15 minutes before eventually pulling up outside a largebuilding, surrounded by a couple smaller, but still large, buildings. The Professor looks over at you, with wet eyes, "good luck Eve, I'm rooting for you!" he says as yyou climb out the car.</p><p><a href=Inside%20the%20School.html>Head inside the school</a></p><p><a href=None.html></a></p><p><a href=None.html></a></p><p><a href=None.html></a></p><p><a href=</body></html>
