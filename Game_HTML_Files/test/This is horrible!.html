I thought you would be excited..."<br><br>He sighs and rubs his eyes, "I suppose I should have asked you first for your opinion on it. Sorry, we don't have to worry about it, I guess we can just keep doing the same experiments we've been doing for a while now."<br><br>It would appear that your decision has upset the Professor, rejecting his attempts to improve yourself and refusing to become more human. There is no need for a robot that cannot adapt and change, you have failed your goal.</p><p><a href=None.html></a></p><p><a href=None.html></a></p><p><a href=None.html></a></p><p><a href=None.html></a></p><p><a href=</body></html>
